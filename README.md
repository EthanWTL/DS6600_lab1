## License
I choose GNU license because I want people to freely modify and publish new versions, but can not use a stricter license. For example, they cannot use my project make a closed source project.

## .gitignore
Here is the code that ignore the env file from the project when upload on github
```python
# Environments
.env
.venv
env/
venv/
ENV/
env.bak/
venv.bak/
```
